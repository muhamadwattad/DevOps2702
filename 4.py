# A
first = 7
second = 44.3

print(first + second)
print(first * second)
print(second / first)

# B
a = 9
b = 8
c = 15
print(f"The Answer Is:\na: {a} b: {b} c: {c}")

# C
name = "john"
name = 'john'
# Yes there is a difference
# The difference is that the first string starts with a double quote and the second one starts with a single quote.
# this will make a problem in the future if we want to use double qotues in the first name then we have to use \.

my_number = 5 + 5

# print("result is: "+my_number)
# You cant print a string added up with a number.
# One of the solutions is:
print(f"result is: {my_number}")

# D

x = 5
y = 2.36

# The Result will be 7, becuase if you parse a float number to int it will turn into int.
# in our example the 2.36 will turn into 2


# Challenge

a = 8
b = "123"

# old

# new
print(a + int(b))
